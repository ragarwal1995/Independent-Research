# Independent-Research
I worked as an undergraduate research assistant for Dr.Yu at the University of Maryland for one semester and conducted research on achieving acoustic levitation using meta materials.


The primary goal of this independent undergraduate research project is to develop an enhanced understanding of the acoustic meta surfaces and use it as a reflector for a single axis leviator to achieve acoustic levitation.
